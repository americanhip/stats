**Intern Stats**

hi interns!! ヾ(＾∇＾)

This repository is for all the stats code! 

I recommend you use RStudio. It allows you to see your variables, datasets, plots, and script in an easier to use format.

##
HOW TO USE:
You can either:
1. Download the code file directly
2. Copy and paste the code into your IDE/editor of choice
3. git pull/fetch if you have Git Bash installed

PLEASE do not commit to the master branch unless you know the code works/you are making major changes. Create a new branch if you have different versions.

        This file has comments for every line so you can be walked through it.
    - Uncommented file
        This file only has one comment so it's cleaner to copy paste it. Use this file only if you understand what the code does.
